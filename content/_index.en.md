The [Nord Reet UG](https://www.nordreet.de/), founded as spin out of the University of Greifswald in
2011, was originally devoted to perform quality analysis of water reed which is widely used as roofing
material in Northern Germany and other European countries. In 2015, as [Dr. Rainer Borriss](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rainer_Borriss),
professor emeritus of Bacterial Genetics at Humboldt University Berlin, took over responsibility, 
a second field of business **Bacillus consulting** was opened. The company is specialized on isolation and
characterization (metabolic properties and genomics) of plant-associated bacilli with plant growth
promoting activity with the potential to be developed as biofertilizer, bio-stimulants, and biocontrol
agents and owned a large collection of such bacteria. Based on rich experience in research and
application we are advising companies interested to develop their own bioformulations (single and
multi-strain inoculants) for use in sustainable agriculture.
